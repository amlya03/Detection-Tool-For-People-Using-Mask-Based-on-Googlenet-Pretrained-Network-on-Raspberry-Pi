# Detection-Tool-for-People-Using-Mask-Based-on-Googlenet-Pretrained-Network-on-Raspberry-Pi
The main focus of this tool is to detect whether someone uses a mask or not, and whether the mask used is in accordance with the existing protocol in a place automatically. The working mechanism of this mask detection tool is a human face recognition system which is carried out with the help of a Raspberry Pi camera which will be connected directly to the Raspberry Pi 3b+ as a processing device. Before doing the introduction, it is necessary to take an image in the form of a sample image as an image datasheet which is saved in .JPEG format. System input is real-time video. The facial recognition method used is GoogLeNet Pretrain Network which is one of the Deep Neural Networks contained in the Matlab program.

# The expected result is a person's face accompanied by writing using a mask, not using a mask, and no people on the viewer in the form of a monitor screen in real-time.
